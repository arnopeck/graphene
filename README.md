# graphene
Graph database for PHP + MySql

# Getting started

## Requirements

## Installation

## Connecting

    include 'graphene/graphene.php';
    
    $db=graphene::open(array(
        "host"=>"localhost",
        "user"=>"root",
        "pwd"=>"root",
        "db"=>"test",
        "port"=>null,
        "prefix"=>"",
        "classpath"=>"./model"
    ));

Replace host, user, password and database name by those of an existing database you have access to. The port can be omitted or set to null if it is the default MySql port (3306). The prefix is only useful if you want several Graphene databases in a single MySql database. The classpath is where Graphene should store its definition files and where it sould search your custom classes if any. We already made the /model/ directory in the Installation section, so let's use it.
